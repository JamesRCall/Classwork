// Purpose: source file for player structure, used to define modifiable values of a player
#include "Game_Header.h"
// I'm not sure if this counts as a global variable but I really hope it doesn't
// otherwise I would have to rewrite a lot of my code to include the structure Player player
// and that doesn't sound really fun.....
Player player = { 100, 3, 0 }; // define the player structure
